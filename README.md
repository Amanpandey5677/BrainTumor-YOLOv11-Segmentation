# BrainTumor-YOLOv11-Segmentation
This project implements a brain tumor detection system using YOLOv11 segmentation, capable of identifying and segmenting three tumor types: Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary Tumor. The dataset is sourced and managed using Roboflow, and model training is done via Ultralytics YOLOv11 on Google Colab. Visualizations of class distribution and inference results help assess model performance. The trained model is exported to ONNX format and deployed using a Gradio-based web interface for interactive testing. This end-to-end pipeline is optimized for medical imaging tasks with an emphasis on accessibility and reproducibility.
